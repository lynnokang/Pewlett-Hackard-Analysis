An analysis was conducted to plan for the retirement of eligible employees at Pewlett Hackard. 
The analysis aimed to answer the questions of who would be retiring in the next few years and how many positions will need to be filled. 
The analysis also generated a list of employees within the company who can be mentored to fill some of the vacancies that will be coming up.

•	 
•	A majority of the mentorship-eligible employees are either senior staff or engineers.
•	There are only 2 managers set to retire.

•	Since the number of employees eligible for mentorship is very low, compared to the number of retirement ready employees, the company can decide to also initiate an informal sort of mentorship within each position, that way the employees who are getting ready to retire can train or cross train their colleagues who may not have qualified for the mentorship. This will ensure that vital knowledge and skills are spread throughout the company.
